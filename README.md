### Description: 

For this project, I only worked on creating a single page and didn't create anything else. It was made to be responsive and it does have a few issues that need to be fixed. The aim of this project was to create a responsive website from scratch. I had learned about HTML and CSS in a web development course which is free for people to watch. And it taught me the basics and then taught me some advanced stuff like how to make it responsive and having a better understanding of a design concept. 


There are a lot of other things that I could of used to improve this design and I also did add a lot of aniamtion by just using CSSm because I like it when a page has some animation that does that.

It was a way for me to understand how to create a website that is responsive on all devices. The project teaches me how to use CSS to create a simple design. The course I used was free and it allowed me to develop my knowledge on web development and giving me a chance to expeire3nce a real design.

### Instructions:

User loads up the webpage and they will be greeted to the single page. 

### What I learnt:
- Stronger understanding of HTML and CSS
- How to use developer tools on Chrome & Firefox
- How to create animation using CSS


### Constraints:

During the design I had a major issue where if I changed a padding by a single decimal it would cause the website to look different between the mobile and the desktop version. Currently this is a bug and I am still yet to resolve it.

### Improvements:

### Improvements:
- Improvement ID: Footer
- Description: 

I think the first thing I should do is re-add the footer back. I did have a problem with this because it wasn't working as intended. I know the fix, but I decided I would save this for another time. But I was thinking of maybe adding in some social media buttons that would help me style it or use some text and apply animation over it.

- Improvement ID: Video Overlap
- Description: 

The video works fine in mobile mode however, if you resize the webpage to a certain size it will cause the user to scroll to the side showing an empty space that is not used. I have a few ideas on how I could approach this but for now I will leave this for another time and fix it later. I would rather go through my solutions first and find the best way before attempting to fix the problem.

- Improvement ID: New Logo
- Description:

I did use a logo off the internet, which was non-copyright. This logo did have a white background which made the columns break, however I can just find a new image with the same height and diameter to solve this problem.

- Improvement ID: Textbox and Image
- Description:

This problem isn't big but I could change the font size and add an animation to it and I could also work on changing the image for it because it doesn't fit and it has an odd shadow box that just doesn't fit with the image.

- Improvement ID: Navbar Background Color
- Description: 

I don't like the navbar background so I am going to change it to something else and maybe I might add in an animation so that it changes to another colour when hovered over.

I think I could work on making the images fit slightly in the centre, but this would mean rework in the mobile version. Also, only a single page works so maybe in the future I am going to link the pages and have them show different things on the website.
