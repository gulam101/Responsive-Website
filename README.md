# Responsive-Website-Project

### Description: 

The aim of this project was to create a responsive website from scratch. It was a way for me to understand how to create a website that is responsive on all devices. The project teaches me how to use CSS to create a simple design.

### Instructions:

User loads up the webpage and they will be greeted to the single page. 

### What I learnt:
- Stronger understanding of HTML and CSS
- How to use developer tools on chrome
- How to create animation using CSS


### Constraints:

During the design I had a major issue where if I changed a padding by a single decimal it would cause the website to look different between the mobile and the desktop version. Currently this is a bug and I am still yet to resolve it.

### Improvements:

I think I could work on making the images fit slightly in the centre, but this would mean rework in the mobile version. Also, only a single page works so maybe in the future I am going to link the pages and have them show different things on the website.
