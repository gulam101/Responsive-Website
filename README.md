### Description: 

For this project, I only worked on creating a single page and didn't create anything else. It was made to be responsive and it does have a few issues that need to be fixed. The aim of this project was to create a responsive website from scratch. I had learned about HTML and CSS in a web development course which is free for people to watch. And it taught me the basics and then taught me some advanced stuff like how to make it responsive and having a better understanding of a design concept. 


There are a lot of other things that I could of used to improve this design and I also did add a lot of aniamtion by just using CSSm because I like it when a page has some animation that does that.

It was a way for me to understand how to create a website that is responsive on all devices. The project teaches me how to use CSS to create a simple design. The course I used was free and it allowed me to develop my knowledge on web development and giving me a chance to expeire3nce a real design.

### Instructions:

User loads up the webpage and they will be greeted to the single page. 

### What I learnt:
- Stronger understanding of HTML and CSS
- How to use developer tools on Chrome & Firefox
- How to create animation using CSS


### Constraints:

During the design I had a major issue where if I changed a padding by a single decimal it would cause the website to look different between the mobile and the desktop version. Currently this is a bug and I am still yet to resolve it.

### Improvements:

### Improvements:
- Improvement ID: Images Center
- Description: 

I think I could work on making the images fit slightly in the centre, but this would mean rework in the mobile version. If i get a different picture then I can change it at anytime but for now, I think I will keep this current image and I will play around with the padding so that it can be placed center in the middle of the page.
