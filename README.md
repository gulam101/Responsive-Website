# Responsive-Website-Project

Description: The aim of this project was to create a reponsive website from sctratch. It was a way for me to understand how top create a website that is reponsive on all devices. The proiect teaches me how to use CSS to create a simple design. 

Instructions: User loads up the webpage and they will be greeted to the single page. 

What I learnt:
- Stronger understanding of HTML and CSS
- How to use developer tools on chrome
- How to create animation using CSS


Constraints: During the design I had a major issue where if I changed a padding by a single decimal it would cause the website to look different between the mobile and the desktop version. Currently this is a bug and I am still yet to resolve it.

Improvements: I think I could work on making the images fit slightly in the centre but this would mean rework in the mobile version. Also only a single page works so maybe in the future I am going to link the pages and have them show different things on the website.
